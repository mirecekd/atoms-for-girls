# Atoms for Girls v1

[Go to version 2](READMEv2.md)

This is integration of multiple projects around Home Assistant to achieve (from google long promised) assistant in czech language.


## How it works
As I dont want to have OpenAI to controll my home, I configured 2 Assist pipelines:
1. pipeline for commanding Home Assistant
2. pipeline for answering questions from GPT-3.5 model

M5Stack Atom Echo listens for wake word and command, send it to Home Assistant Assist and Assist pipeline answers or controlls Home Assistant.

In my setup Atom Echo is only "smart" microphone and all sounds go out from Google Homes around house.

Atom's button long press triggers Assist pipeline change via automation.
